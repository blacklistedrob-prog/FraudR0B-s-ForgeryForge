# FORGERY_FORGE // BLACK_OPS_EDITION 🏴‍☠️

> **The Ultimate AI-Augmented Document Manipulation & Fabrication Suite**

**ForgeryForge** is a "Red Team" grade application designed for security researchers, penetration testers, and authorized social engineers. It leverages a swarm of specialized **Google Gemini AI Agents** to analyze, deconstruct, fabricate, and "perfect" digital documents with forensic-level precision.

## 🔬 PROTOCOL OMEGA: THE FORENSIC STANDARD

**"YOUR EYES LIE. THE MACHINE DOES NOT."**

The difference between a failed attempt and a verified asset is **Agent Omega**. The Omega Forensic Report is not a suggestion box—it is a survival guide. It simulates the exact Error Level Analysis (ELA) and Metadata scrubbing tools used by security professionals to detect manipulation.

### **THE "ZERO-DEFECT" WORKFLOW**
To produce the absolute highest quality result, you must adhere to the **Audit Loop**. Never export without passing this check.

#### **PHASE 1: THE BRUTAL TRUTH**
Run `run_audit` or click **[ Req. Omega Audit ]** immediately after your initial edit. The report will generate a **Tactical Recovery Plan**.
*   **What it detects:** It ignores the "picture" and looks at the *math* of the image.
    *   **Compression Artifacts:** Does the new text have the same "JPEG fuzz" as the old text?
    *   **Noise Floor:** Is the background grain consistent, or does the edited area look "too smooth"?
    *   **Lighting Logic:** Do shadows on the user photo fall in the same direction as the embossed seal?
    *   **Font Rendering:** Is the anti-aliasing (edge softening) matching the printer type (Thermal vs Laser)?

#### **PHASE 2: EXECUTION OF FIXES**
The report gives you a **Game Plan**. You must execute it using the **Terminal** for precision.

**Common Findings & Their Terminal Solutions:**

| OMEGA REPORT FINDING | THE FIX (TERMINAL COMMAND) | WHY IT WORKS |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| *"New text edges are too sharp compared to scan."* | `isp_set_blur value:0.3` | Softens vector edges to match raster scan data. |
| *"Contrast mismatch. Edit area is too black."* | `isp_set_opacity value:92` + `isp_set_grayscale value:100` | Real ink is never #000000. It fades. This blends it. |
| *"Background noise pattern broken in edit zone."* | Use prompt: *"Add ISO noise to match grain."* | Forces the diffusion model to hallucinate grain. |
| *"Document looks too digital/pristine."* | `isp_apply_preset_photocopy` + `isp_set_opacity value:30` | Overlays a dirty scan texture to unify layers. |
| *"Perspective is flat. Looks like a screenshot."* | `spatial_rotate degrees:0.4` | Adds microscopic skew. Scanners never feed perfectly straight. |
| *"Color temperature mismatch."* | `isp_set_sepia value:10` | Warms the cold digital edit to match aged paper. |

#### **PHASE 3: KILL YOUR EGO**
The most important step. You might look at your work and think, *"It looks perfect."*
**If Agent Omega says it is flawed, IT IS FLAWED.**
*   A machine will detect a 2% variance in pixel density that your eye misses.
*   **Trust the Report.** Even if the suggestion seems counter-intuitive (like "Degrade the quality" or "Blur the text"), DO IT. A "perfect" document is a fake document. Real documents have flaws.
*   **Re-Run the Audit:** After applying fixes, run Omega *again*. Keep looping until the Tactical Recovery Plan returns **"NO CRITICAL ANOMALIES DETECTED"**.

## 🚀 FEATURE MANIFEST

### 👁️ **GOD MODE: Zero-Shot Fabrication**
Don't have a template? **Invent one.**
Powered by **Agent Hunter** (Web Scraper) and **Agent Architect** (Blueprint Designer), God Mode allows you to type a request like *"California Parking Violation Ticket 2025"* and watch as the system:
1.  **Scans** the open web for visual references and layout data.
2.  **Constructs** a structural blueprint based on real-world specs.
3.  **Renders** a high-resolution, blank template ready for data entry.

### 🧼 **CLEAN PLATE PROTOCOL (ID Sanitization)**
Upload any ID card, Driver's License, or badge.
**Agent Gamma** automatically identifies PII (Personally Identifiable Information), creates a mask, and **erases the data** while surgically reconstructing complex background security patterns (Guilloche lines, holograms).
*Result:* A perfect blank canvas waiting for a new identity.

### ⚡ **SMART INSERT & TYPOGRAPHY FORENSICS**
Forget manual font matching. **Agent Zeta** analyzes the microscopic pixel data of the original document to detect:
*   **Font Family** (Serif/Sans/Mono)
*   **Exact Size & Weight**
*   **Color Hex & Opacity**
*   **Rotation Angle**
*   **Noise/Grain profile**
Click "Auto-Match" on any layer, and your text disappears seamlessly into the forgery.

### 🛡️ **FORENSIC EVASION (Agent Omega)**
Before you export, run an **Audit**. Agent Omega scans your work for:
*   Digital artifacts & JPEG compression inconsistencies.
*   Lighting mismatches (Shadow logic).
*   Metadata leakage.
*   Font anachronisms.
It provides a ruthless critique to ensure your asset passes visual inspection.

### 📦 **FLAILKIT INTEGRATION**
Seamlessly import assets generated by **Fraud R0b's FlailKit** (Headshots, Barcodes, MRZ strips). The engine allows for precise layering, positioning, and—most importantly—**"baking"**. Use the main prompt to blend external assets into the document's texture, matching grain and lighting perfectly.

## 💻 THE ROOT TERMINAL: VELVETOPS KERNEL

For the elite operator, the GUI is just a suggestion. The **Root Terminal** offers direct access to the application's neural kernel.

**Access:** Click `[ ACCESS ROOT CMD ]` in the header.

### **Capabilities:**
*   **Natural Language Execution:** "Make this look like a photocopy" -> *System applies high contrast, grayscale, and noise filters.*
*   **Tactical Scripting:** Chain commands to build reusable workflows.
*   **OSINT Integration:** Perform real-time background checks on names, domains, and IPs directly from the console to ensure your forgery contains valid data.

### **Advanced Scripting & Sync:**
Pro users can simulate automation by chaining logic.
*Example: The "Ghost Identity" Chain*
```bash
> osint_lookup_username target:"john_doe"
> osint_search_breaches email:"john@example.com"
> crypto_generate_password length:16
> util_generate_iban country:"GB"
```

## 🧠 PRO TIP: THE "PERFECT" BLEND
**Don't just paste layers.** Use the `execute_operation` command with a descriptive prompt to "Bake" the layers.

**Bad Workflow:** Paste ID photo -> Export.
**Elite Workflow:** Paste ID photo -> Terminal:
```bash
> set_operation_prompt text:"Blend this photo. Match the ISO noise of the background. Apply a slight multiply effect so the security waves show through the hair."
> execute_operation
```
